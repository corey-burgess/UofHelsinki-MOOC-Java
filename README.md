# University of Helsinki MOOC: Java

This was my entry point into Java, provided by the University of Helsinki's DEpartment of Computer Science.  My foundation began with this course, the equivalent of two semesters of Java classes.  

Java I was the introductory course.  This course established the basics of Object Oriented Programming.  Starting with simple user input and the notorious "Hello World", through some basics such as Loops, Methods, Objects and ArrayLists, and even touching on some more advanced programming like utilizing Binary Searches.  In all this course contained 106 exercises that crafted a solid foundation of Java programming.

Java II is the continuation of Java I, not only expanding upon what was learned, but also getting more in depth with new components.  This course introduced HashMaps, Interfaces, Inheritance, Read/Write from Files, GUI, Iterators, Enums and more.  This course contained 50 additional exercises that tested my ability to think with Object-Oriented programming in mind.
